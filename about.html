                Amaryllis Island is formed by high points on the rim of 
                the caldera of a submarine volcano that forms a seamount. 
                The volcano is one part of a range that was formed as 
                part of the same process that formed the bottom of the Atlantic.
                The top of the seamount has gone through centuries of complete
                submergence, during which its limestone cap was formed by marine
                organisms, and in the Ice Ages the entire caldera was above sea 
                level, forming an island of approximately two hundred square
                miles.

                When discovered, Amaryllis was uninhabited and mostly 
                dominated by forests of Amaryllis cedar, with mangrove 
                along its shores. Only 50 of the island's current 1,000 
                vascular plant species are considered native. Of those, 15,
                including the eponymous cedar, are endemic

               Today Amaryllis Island consists of 75 islands, with a total area of 43 
                square kilometers. The largest island is Main Island, sometimes 
                called Amaryllis. Nineteen of the larger islands are connected by 
                bridges, and are the populated islands.
